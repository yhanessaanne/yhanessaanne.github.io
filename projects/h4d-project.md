## Hacking 4 Defense Program
The project I worked on was part of the Hacking for Defense program. It is a nationwide initiative that allows university students to work with military personnels to solve readl-world problems in the Department of Defense. Through this program, me and 4 other classmates were assigned with working with a unit training manager from the Hawaii Air National Guard, DET 1 (Detachment 1; 154 MDG - a medical Army and Air Force detachment).

## The Challenge
Unit Training managers need a system to inform servicemembers when they are due for training to track career progression and ensure certification requirements are met. This is important because DET 1 must be up to date on both medical and administrative training in order to respond to mass medical casualties. Managers track individualsâ€™ progress across various systems, but data is not consolidated or user-friendly, making accurate tracking very difficult. Personnel are trained on all platforms to meet individual and group requirements. MRDSS (Medical Readiness Data Support System), TFTR (Total Force Training Record), and ARCnet (Air Reserve Component Network) are just a few platforms used for hazard, advanced cardiac life support, and pediatric life support training.Managers use these disparate systems along with Excel documents to track all personnelcertificates. When a member completes training or is scheduled to begin the next iteration, managers must manually update their certification onto a single spreadsheet.

## Interview Process
My group consisted of myself and two other people. My contribution to this group project was working on the calendar, leaderboard, and list session pages. More specifically I was in charge of creating mockups, getting it to function, and designing those pages. I was very fortunate to have a group partner who was familiar with GitHub so I learned a lot from her, especially when it came to the Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) concept which was an essential part of the project. My other group partner was also very helpful when it came to me struggling on my tasks of the project and is very knowledgeable. Overall, it was great working with them.

## Conclusion
Creating this web application forced me to remember everything I learned from the beginning of my software engineering class and apply all of that into this one project. One of them was IDPM. It taught me that any large project can be tackled when it is broken down into smaller parts. During this project, it reminded me how much I have forgotten about the usefulness of underscore. Because of this, I had to re-learn underscore and their uses. I also was able to strengthen my familiarity with Semantic UI and Meteor.
