summary: Semester long project internship for Business Solution Technologies and Hawaii Teacher Standards Board
---
In the Spring 2023 semester, I had the valuable oppurtunity to intern with Business Solution Technologies. My responsibility for the internship project was to enhance Educator Preparation Program (EPP) features to make importing Completer Programs and manage program fields easier. The project was for the Hawaii Teacher Standards Board.
