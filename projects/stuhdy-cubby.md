## About stUHdy Cubby
stUHdy Cubby is a web application catered to UH Manoa students majoring in Information and Computer Science (ICS). The purpose of this application is to encourage ICS students to study face-to-face with classmates and peer mentors, in order to effectively learn and understand course material. This is because sometimes it can be difficult to study on their own due to distractions and the need for external help. stUHdy Cubby enables ICS students to easily register and create study sessions for various types of work, such as projects, homework, and exam preparation.

## Features
The application's features include the ability to register for a session, create a session, a point reward system, and a calendar to display events

## Contribution
My group consisted of two other people, and my contribution to the project included working on the calendar, leaderboard, and list session pages. Specifically, I was responsible for creating mockups, getting the pages to function properly, and designing them. 

## Takeaways
Creating this web application required me to remember everything I had learned from the beginning of my software engineering class, and to apply that knowledge to this project. IDPM taught me that any large project can be tackled when it is broken down into smaller parts. As a result of this project, I was able to enhance my proficiency in working with React, Semantic UI, and MongoDB, and gained a deeper understanding of their capabilities and functionalities.
